# Phase-5-Group
This project uses next.js and typescript. Note that javascript files may still be used and imported as allowjs is set to true in the tsconfig.json. As per recomendation I have set strict mode to false, which *should* allow for typing of javascript in typescript files (.ts). If this prevents too many issues I will personally handle the conversion. I would prefer to figure this out eraly on of coruse.
